Rancher Turtles is a [Rancher extension](../rancher-extensions.md) that manages the lifecycle of provisioned Kubernetes clusters, by providing integration between your Cluster API (CAPI) and Rancher. With Rancher Turtles, you can:

- Import CAPI clusters into Rancher, by installing the Rancher Cluster Agent in CAPI provisioned clusters.
- Configure the CAPI Operator.

The [Overview](./overview.md) section outlines installation options, Rancher Turtles architecture, and a brief demo. For more details, see the [Rancher Turtles documentation](https://turtles.docs.rancher.com/).
