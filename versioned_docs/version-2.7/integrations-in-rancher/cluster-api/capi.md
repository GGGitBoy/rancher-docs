Rancher Turtles is a [Rancher extension](../rancher-extensions.md) that provides integration between your Cluster API (CAPI) and Rancher to manage the lifecycle of provisioned Kubernetes clusters. The main functionality is outlined below:

- Importing CAPI clusters into Rancher: Installing the Rancher Cluster Agent in CAPI provisioned clusters.
- Configuration support for the CAPI Operator.

The [Overview](./overview.md) section outlines installation options, the main architecture, and a brief demo. For more detailed information, please view the [Rancher Turtles documentation](https://docs.rancher-turtles.com/docs/intro).
